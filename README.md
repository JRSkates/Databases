# Week 3 - Databases

### Phase Zero: Get started

[Watch this introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PJQscmAEI4) before starting the sequence below.

### Phase One: SQL Bites

Go through these exercises and learn how to setup PostgreSQL and use SQL to read and manipulate data stored in an existing database.

<!-- OMITTED -->

1. [Setting up PostgreSQL](./sql_bites/01_setting_up_database.md).
2. [Using `psql` to load data.](./sql_bites/02_using_psql.md)
3. [Querying data.](./sql_bites/03_querying_data.md)
4. [Updating or deleting data.](./sql_bites/04_updating_and_deleting_date.md)
5. [Creating new data.](./sql_bites/05_creating_new_data.md)
6. [Using TablePlus](./sql_bites/06_using_table_plus.md)

### Phase Two: Challenges

<!-- OMITTED -->

Go through these exercises and learn how to setup and gradually build a program which communicates with a database.

Some of these challenges include [Process Feedback Challenges](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md), in which you record yourself performing the task and share it with your coach for feedback. These are tagged with a 游니.

1. [Setting up a project](./challenges/01_setting_up_project.md).
2. [Designing a Repository class](./challenges/02_test_driving_model_repository_classes.md). 游니.
3. [Diagramming a database application](./challenges/03_creating_sequence_diagrams.md). 游니.
3. [Designing a schema with one table](./challenges/04_designing_schema_one_table.md). 
4. [Designing a Repository class "find" method](./challenges/05_test_driving_find_method.md).
5. [Designing a schema with two related tables](./challenges/06_designing_schema_two_tables.md). 
6. [Designing a Repository class "create" and "delete" methods](./challenges/07_test_driving_write_operations.md). 游니.
7. [Wrapping in an Application class](./challenges/08_wrapping_in_application_class.md)

### Phase Three: Joins and Many-to-Many

This is advanced material. Work on it only if you've completed all the challenges above.

1. [Using SQL joins](./joins/01_using_joins.md)
2. [Designing a Repository class using joins](./joins/02_test_driving_repository_class_with_join.md).
3. [Using joins with Many-to-many relationships](./joins/03_using_joins_with_many_to_many.md)
4. [Designing Many-to-many relationships](./joins/04_designing_many_to_many_relationships.md)
5. [Designing a Repository class with Many-to-many](./joins/05_repository_classes_many_to_many.md)

### Phase Four: Solo Project

Do this project solo. It is designed to help you test all of your skills for this module.

Fork the repo and work on your local fork, then open a pull request when you're done.
